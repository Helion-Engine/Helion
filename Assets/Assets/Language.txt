fair -- for you emerge from the door

its legions of hellspawn before your

You've done it. The invasion is over.
Earth is saved. Hell is a wreck. You

their teeth into you. With luck, the

laying around.";

ahead. You sure hope they're not stamping
out new hellspawn, but you're ready to

familiar. Smells familiar, too -- like
fried excrement. You didn't like this

Hefting your gun, an evil grin trickles
onto your face. Time to take some names.";

fades away, the nightmare sky turns to
blue, the heaps of monster corpses start

done it. Have you really won?

Something rumbles in the distance.
A blue light begins to glow inside the
ruined skull of the demon-spitter.";
