SECRETMESSAGE,A secret is revealed!
E1TEXT,"Once you beat the big badasses and
clean out the moon base you're supposed
to win, aren't you? Aren't you? Where's
your fat reward and ticket home? What
the hell is this? It's not supposed to
end this way!

It stinks like rotten meat, but looks
like the lost Deimos base. Looks like
you're stuck on The Shores of Hell.
The only way out is through.

To continue the DOOM experience, play
The Shores of Hell and its amazing
sequel, Inferno!"
E2TEXT,"You've done it! The hideous cyber-
demon lord that ruled the lost Deimos
moon base has been slain and you
are triumphant! But ... where are
you? You clamber to the edge of the
moon and look down to see the awful
truth.

Deimos floats above Hell itself!
You've never heard of anyone escaping
from Hell, but you'll make the bastards
sorry they ever heard of you! Quickly,
you rappel down to the surface of
Hell.

Now, it's on to the final chapter of
DOOM! -- Inferno."
E3TEXT,"The loathsome spiderdemon that
masterminded the invasion of the moon
bases and caused so much death has had
its ass kicked for all time.

A hidden doorway opens and you enter.
You've proven too tough for Hell to
contain, and now Hell at last plays
fair -- for you emerge from the door
to see the green fields of Earth!
Home at last.

You wonder what's been happening on
Earth while you were battling evil
unleashed. It's good that no Hell-
spawn could have come through that
door with you ..."
E4TEXT,"The spider mastermind must have sent forth
its legions of hellspawn before your
final confrontation with that terrible
beast from hell. but you stepped forward
and brought forth eternal damnation and
suffering upon the horde as a true hero
would in the face of something so evil.

Besides, someone was gonna pay for what
happened to Daisy, your pet rabbit.

But now, you see spread before you more
potential pain and gibbitude as a nation
of demons run amok among our cities.

Next stop, Hell on Earth!"
C1TEXT,"You have entered deeply into the infested
starport. But something is wrong. The
monsters have brought their own reality
with them, and the starport's technology
is being subverted by their presence.

Ahead, you see an outpost of hell, a
fortified zone. If you can get past it,
You can penetrate into the haunted heart
of the starbase and find the controlling
switch which holds earth's population
hostage."
C2TEXT,"You have won! Your victory has enabled
Humankind to evacuate earth and escape
the nightmare.  Now you are the only
Human left on the face of the planet.
Cannibal mutations, carnivorous aliens,
and evil spirits are your only neighbors.
You sit back and wait for death, content
that you have saved your species.

But then, Earth Control beams down a
message from space: "Sensors have located
the source of the alien invasion. If you
go there, you may be able to block their
entry.  The alien base is in the heart of
your own home city, not far from the
starport." Slowly and painfully you get
up and return to the fray."
C3TEXT,"You are at the corrupt heart of the city,
surrounded by the corpses of your enemies.
You see no way to destroy the creatures'
entryway on this side, so you clench your
teeth and plunge through it.

There must be a way to close it on the
other side. What do you care if you've
got to go through hell to get to it?"
C4TEXT,"The horrendous visage of the biggest
demon you've ever seen crumbles before
you, after you pump your rockets into
his exposed brain. The monster shrivels
up and dies, its thrashing limbs
devastating untold miles of hell's
surface.

You've done it. The invasion is over.
Earth is saved. Hell is a wreck. You
wonder where bad folks will go when they
die, now. Wiping the sweat from your
forehead you begin the long trek back
home. Rebuilding earth ought to be a
lot more fun than ruining it was."
C5TEXT,"Congratulations, you've found the secret
level! Looks like it's been built by
Humans, rather than demons. You wonder
who the inmates of this corner of hell
will be."
C6TEXT,"Congratulations, you've found the
super secret level! You'd better
blaze through this one!"
