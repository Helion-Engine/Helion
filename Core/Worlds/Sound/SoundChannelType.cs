    /// to find free channels, so if any of these channels go outside of the
    /// range of 0-7 then we will run into some pretty bad issues.
    /// Further, there are arrays that depend on the count of the number of
    /// elements in this enumeration, so if there ever are any changes then
    /// those will need to be updated appropriately.
