    /// This can be thought of as an instance allocated from the sound engine
    /// for some component that manages its own sounds. For example, using the

    /// sounds coming from the world to accidentally bleed into the menus when
    /// not paying attention to stopping all the sounds. To avoid this issue,
    /// all sounds that come from a context will be halted when the context is
    /// to be cleaned up. This means if we kill a layer (ex: we quit a game and
    /// toss out, say, a SinglePlayerWorldLayer) then all of the sounds will be
    /// halted and never bleed into other areas. In ports like ZDoom and such,
    /// Randy said on the forums that it's all done on another thread and this
    /// coding style has led to weird sound leakage issues. This design pattern
    /// will hopefully remedy this. By this, I mean that sounds in the world
    /// still keep playing even after the world has been terminated (disposed).
